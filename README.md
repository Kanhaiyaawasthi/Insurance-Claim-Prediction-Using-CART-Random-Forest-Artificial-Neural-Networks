# Insurance-Claim-Prediction-Using-CART-Random-Forest-Artificial-Neural-Networks
An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. 

By using Various Algorithms like CART, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks we analysed the data and found that More data needs to be collected like there is no unique identifier present so we are unable to clearly distinguished the duplicates also we find out the data points which needs to be collected like Insurance Cost , their location of incident , How often they are travelling , What is their income etc . 

# • Following are my Suggestions to Management 

• Since data set suggest that 90% of insurance done by online mode so we can increase their online experiences and also show the reviews about their insurance for benefitted customers, this will increase the Confidence of customer which will increase the insurance sales and profit too. 

• we have found another interesting fact that more sales happen via Agency than Airlines and the trend shows the claim are processed more at Airline . So we have to find out why this is happening?

• We need to talk with JZI & CWT agency to pick up sales as they Have lower sales (Refer Below figure) , We can also tell them to use Digital marketing tools to increase their reach to the customers . 

• Insurance Company can also increase their Insurance Portfolio by adding more insurance plans like health insurance , Corporate accidental Insurance etc to increase their revenue

## Below are the some Key performance indicators (KPI) of insurance claims are:

 Average Cost Per Claim

 Claim Frequency 

 Average Time to Settle a Claim

 Claims Ratio

 Increase customer satisfaction Based on the above Insurance Company can make automated reporting process to senior officials of the company if a claim is pending from more than 1 week so that genuine claims can’t be neglected this will Build the reputation of the company in the customer’s eye.
